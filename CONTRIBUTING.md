# Contributing Guidelines

## Status

We will not develop new features using this project. We developed new framework called [slang](https://github.com/SonarSource/slang) for SonarQube analyzers and we will migrate
SonarGo plugin to this framework later in 2019. This project will only receive bugfixes and minor improvements.
For any questions feel free to reach out to our [community forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/).
