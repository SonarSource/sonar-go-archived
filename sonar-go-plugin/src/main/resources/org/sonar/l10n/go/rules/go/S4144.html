<p>When two functions have the same implementation, either it was a mistake - something else was intended - or the duplication was intentional, but
may be confusing to maintainers. In the latter case, one implementation should invoke the other.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
func fun1() (x, y int) {
  a, b := 1, 2
  b, a = a, b
  return a, b
}

func fun2() (x, y int) {  // Noncompliant; fun1 and fun2 have identical implementations
  a, b := 1, 2
  b, a = a, b
  return a, b
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
func fun1() (x, y int) {
  a, b := 1, 2
  b, a = a, b
  return a, b
}

func fun2() (x, y int) {  // Compliant
  return fun1()
}
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Functions with fewer than 2 statements are ignored.</p>
